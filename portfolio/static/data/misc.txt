Apart from the technical aspects, I am a nature lover.

I love to go on hikes.

Yet another goal, complete the United States National Park Journal by collecting stamps and visiting them.

Again, we can always meet and plan trips if anybody is interested.

Star gazing, driving, camp-fire, backpacking, oh my god! I am already super excited. 

Biking is also fun.

I spend most of my free time watching TV shows at the gym.
