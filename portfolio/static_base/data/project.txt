Here are some of my major projects that I have completed/currently working on.

One of my projects that stands out and is currently under progress is the Self-Driving car.

This project aims to develop efficient decision-making techniques, utilizing AI with a centralized, decentralized communication architecture, enabling knowledge sharing and faster learning.

The first version of this project entails designing and implementing a level three autonomous vehicle in the Carla Simulator.

In addition to addressing typical driving conditions, it encompasses various tasks and scenarios such as enforcing lane stability, executing overtaking maneuvers, handling roadblocks, and navigating during jaywalking instances (includes the concepts of deep learning, image processing, estimation of state and localization, motion planning, etc.).

The project also presents effective methodologies for managing sensor failures and introduces the innovative concept of knowledge sharing.

I successfully wrote a paper on this topic and can be found here: https://doi.org/10.3390/s23020653.

The current iteration aims to harness additional onboard sensors like LIDAR and RADARS to enhance localization, self-awareness, and maneuverability.

Furthermore, it will showcase how inputs (experience) from other dynamic players in the environment can significantly improve planning and decision-making, expediting the learning process via imitation learning.

The project will also encompass designing dynamic models (interaction and movement models) for predicting the movement of objects in motion and accommodating various weather conditions.

In essence, the objective is to develop a level-four autonomous vehicle. 

Two, Optical Character Recognition, on the other hand, aims to emulate the functionality of the Splitwise application and achieve sketch-to-webpage translation.

As a part of this project, I have successfully annotated a diverse range of receipts sourced from online platforms and physical copies to create a tailored dataset for text detection, recognition, and information extraction and devised a comprehensive end-to-end module that addresses text detection (utilizing CRAFT), text recognition (using ViTs) and information extraction (leveraging GCNs) tasks.

Three, The Co-curricular repository in my GitHub account encompasses a collection of mini and hobby projects showcasing the utilization of cloud platforms like GCP, AWS, and Azure.

It is a testament to the practical application of MLOps and DevOps principles, constructing complete applications for diverse classification tasks.

Additionally, it features introductory programs for web and mobile development.

Four, Last but not least, I am also working on Actor-critic neural network modeling.

It aims to demonstrate the feasibility of substituting deep neural networks with shallow networks to accomplish identical tasks, capitalizing on the experience gained by deep neural networks.

As a first step in this process, I have developed scripts for data generation and a neural network implementation from scratch, adhering to the PyTorch nn framework.

Currently, efforts are directed towards exploring belief networks and neuron-centric gradient computation.

The goal is to discern the most suitable and accurate descent on the error hypersurface by drawing insights from the experience of deep neural networks.
