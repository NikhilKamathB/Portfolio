Hi, here is all about myself.

My name is Nikhil Bola Kamath. I am 25 years old. I was born on the 29th of September, 1998.

I have worked for almost two years now (two years work experience).

My technical interests include: Artificial Intelligence - Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Reinforment Learning and Autonomous systems.

I work at the Robotics Embedded Systems Laboratory, USC, developing adversarial target-tracking algorithms.

Before this, I worked at Insureka/Someshwara Softwares as a Machine Learning Engineer.

As an ML Engineer with nearly 1.5 years of experience, my career objective is to transform my unique ideologies into tangible products.

Throughout my journey at Insureka, I have successfully built OCR pipelines, mastered MLOps and DevOps practices, and created web and mobile applications to enrich my skill set.

With a vast array of frameworks and tools in my repertoire, including PyTorch, PyTorch Lightning, TensorFlow, Keras, Docker, Kubernetes, Git, Django, Flask, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, NodeJS, React, Swift, and Flutter, I am well-equipped to tackle diverse challenges.

My proficiency extends to cloud platforms like GCP, AWS, and Azure, enabling seamless integration of cutting-edge technologies.

I take pride in my track record of delivering end-to-end machine learning pipelines and producing exceptional quality and maintainability code.

Even before this, I was the CTO of a startup - BhavamAI, founded by my undergraduate lecturers.

Collaboration is my forte, and I am dedicated to crafting code that is accessible and user-friendly for my colleagues.
