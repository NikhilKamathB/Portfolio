I did my schooling, till 10th, in Bangalore, India. I finished 10th in the year 2014. Later, I moved to Mangalore, India, at the Canara pre-university college for my 11th and 12th. In my 12th board, I secured 95.7% and stood amongst a few elite students. I specialized in physics, chemistry, math, and electronics during this period.

I have a Bachelor's degree in Engineering - Computer Science and Engineering from Nitte Mahalinga Adyanthaya Memorial Institute of Technology.

After my 12th, I planned to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Engineering, Computer Science being my major. The reason for taking this step is that since childhood, I have been fascinated by vehicles, especially flying objects. I used to hurtle at the window whenever I heard the sound of an airplane, thinking that it passed with some mystical powers possessed by humans, just like the characters of Indian mythology. When I learned the truth behind the flying arena, it shook my verity about the mystical flight. With time, my zeal to convert this fantasy into reality became the primary motivation to take up engineering - particularly AI. Upon realizing its infinite potential for innovation, I chose to excel in this domain to establish Autonomy in flights and vehicles, and this led me to pursue a bachelor's degree in engineering. I started my Bachelor's program in 2016 at Nitte Mahalinga Adyanthaya Memorial Institute of Technology, Nitte, India, and graduated with flying colors in 2020 with a GPA of 4.0.

My undergraduate voyage involved rigorous coursework in Data structures and Algorithms, Business Intelligence, Database Management, and Engineering Mathematics. However, AI and cryptography primarily won my heart. Alongside, I had also enrolled in online courses such as Machine learning, Deep Learning specializations, and the NLP specialization offered by DeepLearning.ai and the Deep Learning Nanodegree program by Udacity, which instilled in me a robust academic foundation and introduced me to various tech stacks.

As an active learner, a Bachelor's degree didn't quench my thirst for knowledge. I needed to pursue higher-level education to improve my knowledge base and networking. My pursuit of a Master's in Computer Science is also driven by my goals of establishing complete Autonomy in vehicles and a startup whose motto would be to develop products in Autonomy and Cognitive Sciences. This graduate program would bolster my knowledge, make me a better professional and researcher, and motivate me to contribute to various open-source communities and technology infrastructures. 

I started my Master's in Computer Science in 2022 at the University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California. The world-class curriculum focused on AI and robotics and the phenomenal pedagogy and abundant research opportunities at the University of Southern California made this program the ideal next step for my career. Some of my detailed course studies included - Analysis of Algorithms, ML and DL, 3D Computer Vision, Robotics, and Applied NLP. I graduated with a Master's degree in Computer Science from USC in 2024 with a GPA of 3.85.
