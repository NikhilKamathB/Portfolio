My name is Nikhil Bola Kamath. I am 25 years old.

I was born on the 29th of September, 1998, in Mangalore, India.

Later, I moved to Bangalore, India, where I studied. So I was in Bangalore from my pre-nursery till my 10th.

I did my 11th and 12th in Mangalore, India, at the Canara pre-university college. In my 12th board, I secured 95.7% and stood amongst a few elite students.

I specialized in physics, chemistry, math, and electronics during this period.

I was in Canara pre-university college between 2014 and 2016, both inclusive.

Since childhood, I have been fascinated by vehicles, especially flying objects.

I used to hurtle at the window whenever I heard the sound of an airplane, thinking that it passed with some mystical powers possessed by humans, just like the characters of Indian mythology.

When I learned the truth behind the flying arena, it shook my verity about the mystical flight.

With time, my zeal to convert this fantasy into reality became the primary motivation to take up engineering. That is when I was introduced to Artificial Intelligence.

Upon realizing its infinite potential for innovation, I chose to excel in this domain to establish Autonomy in flights, and this led me to pursue a bachelor's degree in engineering with computer science as my major.

I started my bachelor's program in 2016 at Nitte Mahalinga Adyanthaya Memorial Institute of Technology, Nitte, India.

My undergraduate voyage involved rigorous coursework in Data structures and Algorithms, Business Intelligence, Database Management, and Engineering Mathematics. However, primarily AI and Cryptography won my heart.

Alongside, I had also enrolled in online courses such as Machine learning, Deep Learning specializations, and the NLP specialization offered by DeepLearning.ai and the Deep Learning Nanodegree program by Udacity, which instilled in me a robust academic foundation and introduced me to various tech stacks.

As a student, I never limited myself to the curriculum.

During my second year, I reverse-engineered an FM radio. I implemented it from scratch, building a voice-controlled robotic car and a computerized periodic heater. 

These activities made me appreciate the need for diversity and inter-domain support towards achieving my ambitions.

During my second year of undergrad, I had a memorable experience related to a course called Digital Systems Design.

We were required to participate in a circuit designing competition as part of the coursework.

Initially, everything went smoothly until a week before the project's due date, when our entire project got short-circuited due to our negligence.

Naturally, we felt a sense of panic and disappointment, and to our surprise, another team faced a similar setback. It seemed like we lost hope.

However, I couldn't back down from the challenge as the team lead. I immediately rallied everyone together, and we started rebuilding the project from scratch.

In a stroke of fortune, we joined forces with the other struggling team, pooling our resources and workforce.

This collaboration allowed us to rebuild the project and submit it on time.

We realized our project was relatively less complex on the presentation day than our competitors.

This realization struck me like lightning. Not only did I foresee our team losing, but I also realized I was about to lose a bet I had made with my friend, owing him nearly five thousand rupees from my piggy bank.

However, I knew effective communication would be crucial in our presentation.

Despite the simplicity of our project, we exceeded the panel's expectations with our exceptional production and delivery.

To our astonishment, we were awarded first place in that academic year.

This victory taught me a valuable lesson about the power of communication.

It reinforced the idea that effective communication can elevate even the simplest of projects to great success.

This experience is one that I will never forget, as it showcased the importance of resilience, teamwork, and the ability to convey ideas to achieve outstanding results effectively.

Despite my academic achievements, I often used to feel incomplete.

The tangible impact of my efforts made me encounter the need to apply my knowledge to address real-world issues for the benefit of society.

I thus started doing projects that mainly focused on research and improving existing concepts.

One of my major projects was the Self-driving car, which demonstrated an autonomous vehicle in a simulated environment.

In addition to fundamental concepts such as visual perception, motion planning, and state estimation, this work introduced two new solutions: handling navigation sensor failures and knowledge sharing across the fleet to enable quick learning.

After elaborate planning and implementation, I successfully wrote a paper on this topic and can be found here: https://doi.org/10.3390/s23020653.

This period reinforced my AI foundation, helped me develop good management skills, and helped me learn optimally.

Academically, it revitalized my interest in physics. Above all, this project was a significant milestone towards achieving my objectives.

During my capstone project, the institution mandated everyone to work in a team to ensure timeliness and quality. Failing to choose meant delaying graduation.

My team had the chance to embark on an internship. Japan's Ritsumeikan University robotics department selected me for an exciting project.

However, the university revoked my offer due to a discontinuation in the overseeing professor's involvement.

This setback cost me a semester, but fate had a different plan.

As the final project deadlines neared, I had two to three months to conceive, execute, and present a substantial project.

Recognizing my determination, my department head allowed me to tackle the project solo.

This period was a turning point.

I embraced the challenge and completed a self-driving car project well before schedule, proving my potential.

Throughout this chapter, I successfully demonstrated my commitment to responsibilities, decisiveness, problem-solving skills, and ability to manage time.

Persevering, I delivered a product that exceeded my professor's quality expectations well before the deadline.

I have also given seminars on DL and various project presentations.

Engineering has bestowed upon me golden opportunities to sharpen my soft skills.

In addition, some of the internship programs that I underwent during my undergraduate studies include one at the Bharat Electronics Limited (Department of Defense), where I led a team and developed a user-friendly web application utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, enabling devotees to manage religious events on campus effortlessly.

The application was seamlessly integrated with MongoDB, empowering smooth implementation of essential CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for enhanced functionality and data management.

And two, at the School of Information Science, where ​​I accomplished the implementation of an AI application using Support Vector Machines (SVM) in Python aimed at detecting trigger words in user speech.

The application further employed speaker recognition techniques to enable the execution of control commands for an Arduino-controlled prototype.

This application showcased the fusion of AI and hardware technology for enhanced user interaction and control in real-world scenarios.

I finally graduated in 2020 with a 4.00 GPA.

As a first step towards building my professional life, I landed as a Machine Learning Engineer at Insureka/Someshwara Software in Bangalore.

Here, I worked with and learned from a highly experienced team.

I am fortunate to have worked with Mr. Darshan Sonde, the CTO of the company, for nearly two years.

Diving deeper into my work experience as an ML engineer, I have worked on building a private annotation website tool within the organization, providing essential key points annotation support for precise pose estimation of vehicles.

I also successfully led the development of optical character recognition (OCR) models using diverse deep learning techniques to effectively detect and recognize various entities on critical Indonesian government documents, such as KTP, STNK, and SIM.

In addition, I Implemented a seamless end-to-end pipeline for the task, as mentioned earlier, supporting crucial stages such as data injection, data cleaning and preprocessing, model training and evaluation, testing, and efficient model deployment (MLOps) using Apache Airflow on the Google Cloud Platform coupled with GIT CI/CD pipeline.

Alongside, I designed a pose estimation model for vehicles, enabling augmented reality guided video capture to automate the "claim" process within the insurance company, streamlining operations effectively.

As a part of this family, I successfully containerized and deployed applications, including ML applications and various other functionalities implemented as APIs, on cloud platforms like Azure and AWS, enabling smooth collaboration between teams within and outside the organization.

Additionally, I actively contributed to further enhancing the development and deployment process by creating automated scripts for web application deployment on remote computers.

Throughout my journey, I have successfully built OCR pipelines, mastered MLOps and DevOps practices, and created web and mobile applications to enrich my skill set.

With a vast array of frameworks and tools in my repertoire, including PyTorch, PyTorch Lightning, TensorFlow, Keras, Docker, Kubernetes, Git, Django, Flask, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, NodeJS, React, Swift, and Flutter, I am well-equipped to tackle diverse challenges.

My proficiency extends to cloud platforms like GCP, AWS, and Azure, enabling seamless integration of cutting-edge technologies.

I take pride in my track record of delivering end-to-end machine learning pipelines and producing exceptional quality and maintainability code.

Collaboration is my forte, and I am dedicated to crafting code that is accessible and user-friendly for my colleagues.

In tandem, I was also the CTO at BhavamAI Technology, founded by my undergraduate degree professors.

As a part of this company, I implemented and delivered a prototype that enables fast retrieval of information from the database using a QR code. A patent for this novelty is under review.

I reinforced my leadership skills through task delegation and efficient project planning.

As an active learner, I needed to pursue higher-level education to improve my knowledge base and networking.

My pursuit of a Master's in Computer Science is driven by my goals of establishing complete Autonomy in vehicles and a startup whose motto would be to develop products in Autonomy and Cognitive Sciences.

Ultimately, I aim to have a working concept ready for autonomous flights.

This graduate program would bolster my knowledge, make me a better professional and researcher, and motivate me to contribute to various open-source communities and technology infrastructures. 

The world-class curriculum focused on AI and robotics and the phenomenal pedagogy and abundant research opportunities at the University of Southern California made this program the ideal next step for my career.

Prof. Aram Galstyan's contributions to the coordination of robotic swarms and multi-agent system learning, Prof. Ram Nevatia's work on Computer Vision, and Prof. Sven Koenig's research on Automated Planning and Scheduling convinced me that I would be under the mentorship of experienced and able faculty whose insights will benefit me greatly.

Of course, I was also motivated by other faculty members in the Computer Science Department, particularly from the AI, Data Science, and Intelligent Robotics streams.

My desired track is my courses such as Analysis of Algorithms, ML and DL, Mathematics of High-Dimensional Data, Advanced Computer Vision, Robotics, Large-Scale Optimization for ML, and Applied NLP.

My interaction with alumni via social media like LinkedIn asserted that this program suited me most.

Therefore, I landed at USC to pursue my master's in computer science in the year 2022.

As of 2023, I have taken courses such as Machine Learning, Algorithms, Web technologies, Foundations of Artificial Intelligence, RDBMS, and Applied Natural Language Processing with a GPA of 3.75.

Since October 2022, I have been working as a research assistant at the Robotics Embedded Systems Laboratory at USC.

Here, I am actively engaged in designing and implementing adversarial object tracking algorithms, with a primary focus on strategically influencing the target of interest within the environment.

The main objective of these algorithms is to skillfully lead the targets into desired states while continuously responding to quad-copters and exhibiting cover-seeking behaviors.

One of my projects that stands out and is currently under progress is the Self-Driving car.

This project aims to develop efficient decision-making techniques, utilizing AI with a centralized, decentralized communication architecture, enabling knowledge sharing and faster learning.

The first version of this project entails designing and implementing a level three autonomous vehicle in the Carla Simulator.

In addition to addressing typical driving conditions, it encompasses various tasks and scenarios such as enforcing lane stability, executing overtaking maneuvers, handling roadblocks, and navigating during jaywalking instances (includes the concepts of deep learning, image processing, estimation of state and localization, motion planning, etc.).

The project also presents effective methodologies for managing sensor failures and introduces the innovative concept of knowledge sharing.

As mentioned before, this project was associated with my undergraduate degree and was my final-year project.

The following link is a sample of my work https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IXyGhBM2OLqZS4HTRtfFpyoeYW-f11aI/view?usp=sharing.

The current iteration aims to harness additional onboard sensors like LIDAR and RADARS to enhance localization, self-awareness, and maneuverability.

Furthermore, it will showcase how inputs (experience) from other dynamic players in the environment can significantly improve planning and decision-making, expediting the learning process via imitation learning.

The project will also encompass designing dynamic models for predicting the movement of objects in motion and accommodating various weather conditions.

In essence, the objective is to develop a level-four autonomous vehicle. 

Optical Character Recognition, on the other hand, aims to emulate the functionality of the Splitwise application and achieve sketch-to-webpage translation.

As a part of this project, I have successfully annotated a diverse range of receipts sourced from online platforms and physical copies to create a tailored dataset for text detection, recognition, and information extraction and devised a comprehensive end-to-end module that addresses text detection (utilizing CRAFT), text recognition (using ViTs) and information extraction (leveraging GCNs) tasks.

The Co-curricular repository in my GitHub account encompasses a collection of mini and hobby projects showcasing the utilization of cloud platforms like GCP, AWS, and Azure.

It is a testament to the practical application of MLOps and DevOps principles, constructing complete applications for diverse classification tasks.

Additionally, it features introductory programs for web and mobile development.

Last but not least, I am also working on Actor-critic neural network modeling.

It aims to demonstrate the feasibility of substituting deep neural networks with shallow networks to accomplish identical tasks, capitalizing on the experience gained by deep neural networks.

As a first step in this process, I have developed scripts for data generation and a neural network implementation from scratch, adhering to the PyTorch nn framework.

Currently, efforts are directed towards exploring belief networks and neuron-centric gradient computation.

The goal is to discern the most suitable and accurate descent on the error hyperplane by drawing insights from the experience of deep neural networks.
